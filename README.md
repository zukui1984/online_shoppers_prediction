Only **15.5%** of visitors make a purchase. This model predicts who will buy so e-commerce sites can:
- Show targeted offers to high-intent visitors
- Send cart reminders to medium-intent users
- Optimize ad spend on likely buyers

**Impact:** 100k visitors → $200k/month extra revenue targeting top 20%
